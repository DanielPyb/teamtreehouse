    <p>
      This easy pasta sauce will cook in about the same time it takes to cook
      some dried pasta in boiling salted water - we're talking about quick and
      easy options here. These amounts serve 2 but are easy to scale up or down.
      Remember you want about 75g of dried pasta per person - use whatever shape
      you've got. Or, check out my super-simple method for fresh pasta, using
      just flour and water.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>150 g dried spaghetti</li>
      <li>1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>2 free-range eggs</li>
      <li>30 g Parmesan cheese, plus extra for grating</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet
        instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice the bacon and place in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat
        with half a tablespoon of olive oil and a really good pinch of black
        pepper. Leave it to get super-golden and crispy, tossing occasionally,
        then turn off the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, then finely grate in the Parmesan
        and mix well.
      </li>
      <li>Use tongs to transfer your pasta straight into the pan and toss.</li>
      <li>
        Pour the Parmesan eggs into the pan, and keep everything moving,
        loosening with splashes of the pasta cooking water until you have a
        silky sauce. Make sure the pan is not too hot otherwise the eggs will
        scramble.
      </li>
      <li>Plate up the pasta, and finish with an extra grating of Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
